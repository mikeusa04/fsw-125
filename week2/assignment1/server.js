/*In this project, you will put into practice the knowledge youâ€™ve gained from the Week 2 material and create your first server.
Create a server that has at least 3 unique endpoints (for example: /movies,  /actors, etc)
Each endpoint should send back a different array of objects when tested.
Endpoints should follow the design principles of REST.
*Note: No frontend is required when testing servers, the functionality can be tested in the browser or in Postman by requesting to the localhost port.*/
